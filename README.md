Extract text from images, videos, QR codes, barcodes and colors with a simple snip mechanism.


## Features
- Very quick extraction process (Can set fidelity between fast and accurate as per the Apple Vision framework)
- Can extract text based on all languages or select your language in settings for quicker/accurate captures
- Copies to clipboard automatically, ready to paste
- Post-processing option to execute shell commands when capture is taken. Can use the captured text via `[ocr]` token within the shell commands
- Customizable hotkeys for the main app functions
- Shows copied text in a floating window, which can be set to auto-hide as well after a custom wait period
- Enable or disable line breaks in the extracted text
- Append multiple text snippets to the clipboard by enabling Append option in Settings, otherwise it only holds one snippet at a time
- Saves captures in History and persists app restarts
- Also saves History to iCloud Drive if enabled
- Launch at login option
- Custom auto-updater that pulls latest release notes and binaries from GitHub Releases
