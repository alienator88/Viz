Extract text from images, videos, QR codes, barcodes with a simple snip mechanism.


## Features
- 100% Swift
- Small app size (~3MB)
- Very quick extraction process
- Copies to clipboard automatically, ready to paste
- Post-processing option to execute shell commands when capture is taken. Can use the captured text via `[ocr]` token within the shell commands
- Hotkeys CMD+Shift+1 and CMD+Shift+2 for starting a text or qr/barcode scan. These can be cleared out and custom hotkeys can be set by user
- Shows copied text in a floating window, which can be set to auto-hide as well
- Enable or disable line breaks in the extracted text
- Append multiple text snippets to the clipboard by enabling Append option in Settings, otherwise it only holds one snippet at a time
- Launch at login option
- Custom auto-updater that pulls latest release notes and binaries from GitHub Releases (Viz should be ran from /Applications folder to avoid permission issues)

## Requirements
- MacOS 13.0+ (App uses some newer SwiftUI functions/modifiers which don't work on anything lower than 13.0)
- Open Viz first time by right clicking and selecting Open. This adds an exception to Gatekeeper so it doesn't complain about the app not being signed with an Apple Developer certificate
